# TreviAV
My own anti-virus, based on [r/TronScript](https://old.reddit.com/r/TronScript/).\
To download it, click Code, and then Download ZIP, or use [this link](https://github.com/aritz331/TreviAV/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
> **Warning**\
> You must download Tron separately for now. I'm soon going to make the script download Tron separately.

This anti-virus is currently a PoC (Proof of Concept) and it isn't complete.\
Please, open an issue with title "[FEATURE SUGGESTION]" + the feature(s) to leave a suggestion.
